I wanted to create a simple time based game that is easy and fun for all ages to play. In this game that I created, you have to hurry and try to find the white circles and click them before the time runs out! so be quick and try to win! I designed this game with the intent for it to be easy to play. There are different levels that you could choose to mach the difficulty that you are looking for. This game isnot super hard or challenging but rather relaxing. All you have to do is try to beat the game before the time runs out. As the levels get harder, so does the time restraint. So be careful and habe fun!
